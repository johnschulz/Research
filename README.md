A portfolio of the work I completed as a student in DIG HUM 101. This repository is composed of two projects, one I did independently and a group project I did with Jack Xie, Matthew Mason, and Mariana Linares. Both of these projects were research based and focused on understanding and applying Digital techniques in the humanities.

# Independent Project
## Black Lives Matter in the News: Data Collection and Sentiment Analysis
An exploration of how the news has been portrayed the Black Lives Matter movement and other conflicting movements including Blue Lives Matter and All Lives matter over the past month. My project is composed of multiple Jupyter notebooks to collect data, analyze the sentiment of the news and visualize my findings. Collectively, these Jupyter Notebooks work together to answer my reasearch question: How does the news portray the Black Lives Matter and other counter-movements including All Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter in the headlines they choose to share and words they use to describe events? 

Check out the data I collected here:

# Group Project
## Data in the Humanities: Interpreting the Humanities in a Digital World
A critical analysis of the methodologies and interpretion required to effectively understand digital information in the humaninities. Through close reading and research into six articles, my group concludes that technology cannot simply subsitute historically critically aware perspectives of humanists, but rather should be used in tandem to provide evidentary support that help produce informed conclusions.
